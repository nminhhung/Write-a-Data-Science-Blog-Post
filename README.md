# Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used "Carbon emissions from electricity generation" dataset for this project. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/berhag/co2-emission-forecast-with-python-seasonal-arima/data

This project focuses on answering following questions: "Analyze fuel factors in the power and energy industry that affect the environment and explain the causes. At the same time, forecast the future trend of one of those factors?"

# Libraries
I use Python3 and ARIMA algorithm to build model and make prediction. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Pmdarima
- Statsmodels

# File Descriptions

- project_1.ipynb jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations.
- MER_T12_06.csv original dataset in csv format

# Resolution
- Carbon emissions from electicity production dataset
- Credit: Monthly/Annual carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation from the Energy Information Administration. Data is broken down by fuel type.
